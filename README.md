## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I’ve implemented some things I learned over the last couple of weeks and before that. Biggest getaway from the past couple of learning sessions is getting a basic grasp of flexbox and understanding absolute positioning and centering an item in the exact middle of its container.

### Continued development

Next step is learning more about flexbox and dipping my toes in grid. I’d also like to add a button for dark mode in the near future. I’ve already been tinkering with the css mix-blend-mode property for this; just need to learn how to toggle things with JavaScript.
