## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I’ve implemented some things I learned over the last couple of weeks and before that. Biggest getaway from the past couple of learning sessions is getting a basic grasp of flexbox and understanding absolute positioning and centering an item in the exact middle of its container.

### Continued development

Next step is learning more about flexbox and dipping my toes in grid. I’d also like to add a button for dark mode in the near future. I’ve already been tinkering with the css mix-blend-mode property for this; just need to learn how to toggle things with JavaScript.
